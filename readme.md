## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Authentication Setup
The dashboard uses a simple codename-based authentication system that **requires Supabase**. The codename must be stored in your Supabase database.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** There is no default codename. You must set up Supabase and insert your codename in the database.

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Configure Supabase** (if not already done):
   - Set up your Supabase project in `storage.js` (see Cloud Storage Setup section below)

2. **Insert your codename into Supabase:**
   - Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard (SQL Editor):
   ```sql
   -- Create the app_settings table
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_settings (
     key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     value TEXT NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   ALTER TABLE app_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create policy for anonymous access
   CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous access" ON app_settings
     FOR ALL
     USING (true)
     WITH CHECK (true);

   -- Insert your codename (REPLACE 'YOUR_CODENAME_HERE' with your actual codename)
   INSERT INTO app_settings (key, value, updated_at)
   VALUES ('auth_codename', 'YOUR_CODENAME_HERE', NOW())
   ON CONFLICT (key) 
   DO UPDATE SET 
     value = EXCLUDED.value,
     updated_at = NOW();
   ```

3. **How it works:**
   - On first visit, you'll see a login screen
   - Enter your codename (stored in Supabase) to access the dashboard
   - **Session timeout:** You stay logged in for **30 days** (configurable in `auth.js`)
   - Session is automatically validated on each page load
   - Authentication only accepts codenames from Supabase database
   - **Logout:** Click the menu button (‚ò∞) in the header and select "Logout"

**Security Notes:**
- Only codenames stored in your Supabase `app_settings` table will work
- If Supabase is not configured or codename not found, authentication will fail
- This is suitable for personal use. For production apps, consider using Supabase Auth or similar services.

### Cloud Storage Setup (Supabase)
The dashboard supports cloud synchronization via Supabase. To enable cloud sync:

1. Open `storage.js`
2. Find the `SUPABASE_CONFIG` object at the top of the file
3. Update the configuration:
```javascript
const SUPABASE_CONFIG = {
  url: 'https://your-project.supabase.co',  // Your Supabase project URL
  anonKey: 'your-anon-key',                 // Your Supabase anonymous key
  enabled: true                              // Set to true to enable cloud sync
};
```

4. Create the todos table in your Supabase dashboard (SQL Editor):
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  who TEXT,
  what TEXT,
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'low',
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous access" ON todos
  FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

5. Test the connection by opening browser console and running: `testSupabaseConnection()`

**Note:** 
- If Supabase is not configured, the app automatically falls back to localStorage
- Data is always saved locally first, then synced to cloud
- Works offline with automatic sync when connection is restored

### Git Integration Setup
The terminal bar displays real-time Git repository information using the GitHub API. To configure it for your repository:

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `GIT_CONFIG` object near the top of the file
3. Update the values:
```javascript
const GIT_CONFIG = {
  owner: 'your-github-username',  // Your GitHub username
  repo: 'your-repository-name',   // Your repository name
  branch: 'main'                  // Your default branch (main or master)
};
```

**Note:** This uses the public GitHub API, so it works best with public repositories. For private repositories, you would need to implement authentication.
