## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Git Integration Setup
The terminal bar displays real-time Git repository information using the GitHub API. To configure it for your repository:

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `GIT_CONFIG` object near the top of the file
3. Update the values:
```javascript
const GIT_CONFIG = {
  owner: 'your-github-username',  // Your GitHub username
  repo: 'your-repository-name',   // Your repository name
  branch: 'main'                  // Your default branch (main or master)
};
```

**Note:** This uses the public GitHub API, so it works best with public repositories. For private repositories, you would need to implement authentication.
